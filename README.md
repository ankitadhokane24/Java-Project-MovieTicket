# Java-Project-MovieTicket
Simple console based project for movie ticket booking using collection.

The movie ticket booking Java-based console project is a software application designed to facilitate users in booking movie tickets through a command-line interface. Users can register as customers or owners, log in securely, and book tickets for available movies at specified show timings. The system allows customers to view available movies and seats, select desired seats, and make bookings.
Owners can add new movies to the system, each with multiple show timings. The project aims to provide a convenient and efficient way for users to book movie tickets while providing owners with a platform to manage movie listings and bookings.
